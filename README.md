# R scripts for prote(omics) data analysis
This repo (work in progress) will host a collection of R scripts used in prote(omics) analysis.

**Coefficient of variation (CV) plot:** R script for creating a CV plot with proteomics data.
> The original code was modified from the [r-graph-gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-scatterplot-and-ggrepel.html) scatter plot chart type to plot CV graph.

**Volcano plot:** R script for creating a volcano plot with proteomics data.The data used in here was adapted from our publication related to [COVID-19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10092762/) study.
> The code was adopted from the [EnhancedVolcano](https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano) repository. This repository is an excellent resource for plotting the volcano plot and adding complex features to make it more informative.
